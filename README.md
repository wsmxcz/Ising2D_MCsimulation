## Overview

This project implements a parallelized 2D Ising model simulation. The code is optimized to run multiple temperature simulations in parallel while ensuring accurate equilibration.

- NumPy
- Numba
- Matplotlib
- pandas
- tqdm
- SciPy

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy numba matplotlib pandas tqdm scipy
```

## Project Structure

- `Ising2D.py`: Core Ising model implementation with Numba optimization
- `MCMC.py`: Monte Carlo simulation methods (Metropolis algorithm)
- `run.py`: Main simulation runner with parallel temperature processing
- `analysis.py`: Data analysis tools for computing observables and storing results
- `plot.py`: Visualization tools for generating publication-quality figures

## Usage

Run the simulation with default parameters:
```bash
python run.py
```

The simulation will:
1. Run the 2D Ising model for system sizes L = 10, 20, and 30
2. Process temperatures from 0.015 to 4.5
3. Store results for each system size in CSV files
4. Combine results and generate analysis plots

## Physics Background

The 2D Ising model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. It consists of discrete spin variables on a lattice, with nearest-neighbor interactions. The model undergoes a phase transition at a critical temperature Tc â‰ˆ 2.269 (in units of J/kB).

The simulation calculates several key observables:
- Energy and specific heat
- Magnetization and magnetic susceptibility
- Critical temperature estimates via finite-size scaling

## Performance Optimization

This implementation includes several optimizations:
- Parallel temperature processing for multi-core utilization
- Numba-compiled core functions for near-C performance
- Temperature-dependent equilibration strategy
- Ordered initialization for low temperatures

## Time Cost

On an 8-core AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX, it takes approximately 10 minutes (with default parameters).

## Future Improvements

Several advanced algorithms and techniques could be implemented to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the simulation:

- **Heat Bath Algorithm**: An alternative update scheme where the new spin state is directly sampled from the Boltzmann distribution, providing an acceptance rate of 1, potentially more efficient than the current Metropolis algorithm.

- **Cluster Update Algorithms**: Implementing Wolff or Swendsen-Wang algorithms to flip entire clusters of aligned spins simultaneously, which significantly reduces critical slowing down near phase transitions.

- **Worm Algorithm**: A technique that rewrites the system variables to improve sampling efficiency near critical points, particularly valuable for complex models.

- **Parallel Tempering**: Also known as replica exchange, this method exchanges configurations between simulations at different temperatures to help systems escape local energy minima, especially useful for complex energy landscapes.

- **Coupling from the Past**: An advanced technique for exact sampling from equilibrium distributions in finite time, providing mathematical guarantees on equilibration.

- **GPU Acceleration**: Moving the core simulation code to GPU using CUDA or other frameworks could provide significant performance improvements for larger lattice sizes.
